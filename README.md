[00:14.16] They've sped up to the point where they provoke
[00:17.07] The punchline before they have told the joke
[00:20.39] Plenty of desperation to be seen
[00:23.52] Starin' at the television screen
[00:26.78] They've sped up to the point where they provoke
[00:28.98] You to tell the fuckin' punchline before you have told the joke
[00:32.96] Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
[00:36.24] It wasn't in the Top 100 list
[00:50.74] 
[00:39.13] And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
[00:43.14] Don't be surprised when you get bent over
[00:46.57] They told you, but you were dyin' for it
[01:06.57] 
[00:52.35] She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
[00:55.49] The kids all dream of makin' it, whatever that means
[00:58.98] Another variation on a theme
[01:01.23] A tangle on the television and the magazine
[01:05.26] D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
[01:08.50] D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
[01:10.97] That says that "We are defenders of any poser
[01:16.29] Or professional pretender around"
[01:32.79] 
[01:23.21] And when did your list replace the twist and turn
[01:27.37] Like a fist replaced a kiss?
[01:29.80] Don't concern us with your bollocks
[01:32.65] I don't want your prayer
[01:35.84] Save it for the mornin' after
[01:50.34] 
[02:02.45] And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
[02:06.27] Don't be surprised when you get bent over
[02:09.87] They told you, but you were gaggin' for it
[02:30.87] 
[02:15.54] Let's have a game on the teddy picker
[02:17.27] Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
[02:18.87] Already thick and you're gettin' thicker
[02:22.18] Let's have a game on the teddy picker
[02:23.83] Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
[02:25.34] Already thick and you're gettin' thicker
[02:45.34] 
[02:28.58] Presumin' that all things are equal
[02:31.67] Who'd want to be men of the people
[02:36.72] When there's people like you?
